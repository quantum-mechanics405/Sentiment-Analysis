In this repository, I am using the pre-trained Sentiment Analysis model to classify the user-given sentiment into positive and negative. The model also finds its accuracy by testing against the 800 reviews taken from the IMDB dataset. and the model almost got 91% on that set. I think that is satisfactory.
